Tasio Victoria


Tasio Victoria. Victoria is my last name. (pronunciation: Tah  see  oh)


Spent the last few years getting my CS degree from the University of Miami. After college I wanted to learn more about web development and modern programming practices so I signed up for HR.


Miami, FL


My tech interests include: Internet of Things, Automation, Automotive Software, and A.I.


Java from college. Basic web development skills. Some database modeling experience. Some Android programming experience.


I enjoy living a somewhat balanced lifestyle. I'm into healthy eating, nutrition, and regular exercise. I enjoy going out for drinks from time to time.




Benny Hung


Benny Hung


I studied in UC Berkeley for a few years with an intended Computer Science major before I took a 1.5 year break to do professional gaming (League of Legends). I heard about Hack Reactor a long while back, but still planned to continue my education at Cal and get my career until this past summer. Instead of studying for another 2 years, I finally decided to go with the Hack Reactor route.


I currently live off of the UC Berkeley campus and was born and raised in the Bay Area.


For quite some time now, I've wanted to develop some sort of app to help improve the lives of people who use it. I don't know what it is I want to develop yet, but I hope I can figure it out in the next couple months.


I took one class, CS61A, at UC Berkeley which was in Python and a Beginner's C++ class at a community college. Aside from that, I've only read a few chapters and articles here and there.


BEER! I love beer (prefer the darker ones like porters and stouts, but IPA is great, too!). I also love me some scotch or whiskey.
As mentioned earlier, I played a game called League of Legends profesionally for 1.5 years, but I don't play much games now aside from Hearthstone now and a phone game called Summoner's War.
To sum up the rest of my interests... I love traveling and trying all kinds of new foods.




Edison DuBose Huf


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) Edison Huff ( Rhymes with Medicine Stuff)


I grew up in New Hampshire then got a BS in Molecular Biology, Chemistry,
and wasting time on league of legends from the College of William and Mary in Virginia. (I see you XDG Benny). I came out to California to do bacterial genetic engineering and then wound up working for Bayer Healthcare. I just finished up my last project there yesterday (Hence the late reply).


I moved from San Jose to Oakland to be closer to school.
I'm currently one block from 19th St Bart and will be commuting from there.


In terms of hobbies I love playing with home automation, phillips hue has been a lot of fun and I want to get better with the android app Tasker to streamline things in the home.
I think Augmented reality will be a very real thing in the near future (i mean we already have snapchat filters).
For work I'm just hoping that I'll find something as meaningful as my work at Bayer.


I took a couple years of class in Highschool, C#, VB, and Java
I wanted to become an independent mobile app developer in 2015 and made moves towards that by studying on codecademy, and working with an awesome framework called Meteor.js
I got hung up on facebook integration and decided I could use a little
more structure.


I have Panamanian citizenship. I've driven from NH to CA. I like to spend my time being bad at guitar, indoor rock climbing, and taking photos.




Brian Fogg


Brian Fogg (silent second g. "fog")


 Working as a sound and lighting technician for special events, live music, large shows around the bay area.
 Performing and recording in several bands. Drums and
 keyboards.
 Teaching / working at a k8 school in El Cerrito.


I live in El Cerrito but I'll be staying in the mission district for the duration of HR.  


 Software control of theatrical lighting systems.
 Exploring new methods to control my music recording and studio production workflows.  Design of new instruments which require advanced software.
 Building automation and organization systems for disorganized people.


I started using max msp a few years ago. I eventually hit the limit of what this visual programming system could do and started experimenting with php, javascript and lately a little ruby. C is on the horizon.


I've been teaching music for several years now. I'll probably try and give a talk on music theory at some point. If you're at all interested in music theory or musicianship, get in touch!




Gerrit Yntema


Gerrit Yntema. I go by Gerrit, pronounced like Garrett. My last name is tough so bare with me. EINtuhmuh or something like that.


I've been living and working in Santa Monica at a startup online tutoring company for the past year doing digital marketing, product design and biz dev. Before that I lived in Detroit doing real estate development. Born and raised in
 Michigan, graduated from University of Michigan in 2011.


Santa Monica, CA.


I'm extremely interested in things like AI and how tech is changing the way people communicate and connect. I'm very into things that are will designed.


A C++ class in college, Visual Basic coding at one of my jobs and HTML/CSS at my most recent job while designing our UI. Outside of that, just playing around with online courses.


I'm a big fan of outdoor activities: surfing, climbing, snowboarding, hiking, fly fishing, etc. If anyone is down for some day trips on Sundays, let me know!
I've had three different jobs since I graduated college in 2011 and I've never been as excited about them as I am about starting this program.




Shane McGraw


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) 
Shane McGraw (I go by Shane).


I've been working at a webinar company, heading up their tech support team and learning JS in my free time. Before 2014 I lived in the Midwest, graduating from Purdue (I see that Big 10, Gerrit!), and moving to SF afterwards.


Not much of a change in location; I
 live here in San Francisco.


Love data visualization! I also teeter between amazement and a slight fear of automation / AI... but I think it's awesome.


I started learning C and MATLAB in college, and have since developed a few web pages for work here and there with HTML, CSS, & JS. Many a day spent on Stack Overflow.


Really enjoy music I sing a bit and play a few instruments. Also love backpacking and exploring northern CA. I've been told I do a mean early20th century mobster impression.




Daniel Kim


My name is Daniel Kim. If want to call me Danny, either is fine!


I graduated last year at Sacramento State with a bachelors in Economics. I didn't work in my field because it's something I did not have passion for. Why did I major in it? I wanted to work for Wall Street, but realize down the road that it isn't for me lol. Basically, I was walking aimlessly, until I found about Hack Reactor. This is what I want to do as a career and hobby.


 I am coming from the city San Jose!


I really love tech and science. Any type of innovation gets my geekyenergy rolling. Star Trek fans anyone? I always had this fascination with tech that contributes to the betterment of mankind. I am big fan of Tesla, and it's these type of people who inspire me and to 'never stay comfortable in life.' I always want to have goals, and not live day by day. I can't forget Neil Degrasse Tyson, Michio Kaku, and BillNye (Bill Bill Bill)! They really contribute to making science cool. In the near future, I really want to get into robotics. I think it is the future, especially the medical augmentation aspect (maybe even augmentation addict centers, a good idea for you! lol).


 None. I started to learn in April, but that is about it. I was kind of on and off, then I got serious. To be honest, I really wished I went into this field a lot earlier. I just had this imposter syndrome that this is the field of geniuses. However, I realize anyone can do anything as long as you stay on course and stay passionate. Better late than never.


Not much to say as I stayed indoor most of the time lol. I played a lot of video games from Atari, Genesis, to the PS4! Occasionally, I would go outdoor with my father as he likes to hunt Boars, Bears, and Deer. I don't like hunting, but I do sometimes reload ammo for for my dad lol. Also, I had many pets, especially hunting dogs. So far, I have had pet Snakes, Mice, Guinea pigs, lizards, fishes, Cherokee birds, many dogs and cats, piglets, and even a pigeon! Currently, I have 4 dogs; They are 2 Walker hounds, Maltese and a Chihuahua. Recently, I got really into whiskey. I enjoy Bourbon, Scotch, and Irish whisky, in a (putting on the big boy pants) glass, neat! If you're wanting a drink, I'll join you!




Elliot Plant


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) 
Elliot Plant (ELeeit).


I've been studying Mechanical Engineering at UCLA, interning at Tesla Motors, and surfing. I realized all of my favorite classes had been coding or design classes, so I figured I would do Hack Reactor to finally focus on something I really love.


Los Angeles, but I grew up in the Bay Area.


 I'm a huge fan of wearables and Arduino stuff, and I think the world of tiny computers in everything is going to be pretty awesome. I also like puzzles and simple AI video games.


I was introduced to CS in college via C++ and Matlab. Along the way, I've done some development in the Arduino IDE, LabView, Swift, and Lisp. I've really liked JavaScript so far, but CSS is still somewhat of a mystery to me.


I love building everything from wires and solder to hamers and nails. I learned to surf recently and I've found it addicting, so I would love to try to catch some waves with you guys! I also like working out with friends, so I'll be looking for a workout buddy.




Andrew Bresee


Andrew Bresee (try saying Zebra a bunch of times fast until the last syllable comes first and the first comes last) "zeBRA zeBRA zeBRA....BRAze"


I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park in May 2014. I then spent a year in San Luis Obispo CA as a Team Leader for an AmeriCorp program called the Watershed Stewards Program.
  Before that I was interning for an environmental consulting firm that did urban stream restoration, and before that I was working for a nonprofit I cofounded in college.


I was living in San Luis Obispo (SLO) for a year. A nice beach town right between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Before that I was living in College Park Maryland, a suburb of Washington DC.


Oh lots of stuff! But the two fields I am most interested in are AI and Virtual Reality. I get excited by the applications of VR and the potential gains humanity can make from AI.
I am particularly excited by the future of big data analytics and the potential insights we can make with really cheap measuring equipment everywhere.
Lower hanging fruit would be designing web interfaces and general UI. I like design and making websites both look nice and function very well.


Very little besides the precourse. I played around on coderbyte for a little before applying to HR.


I really like to cook! I am a big fan of experimenting with flavors and tastes. You all may experience me bring in some interesting dishes (depending on how much time I have).
I like outdoor activities, especially more intense ones. I enjoy backpacking, trail running, mountaineering, etc. A few years ago I completed the the Four State Challenge on the ATC (hiking through 4 states in under 24 hours).
I am also interested in human behavior and motivation. I like to think a lot about what makes people tick, and how to make people more awesome and productive.




Jake Pace


Jake Pace  pronounced just like you’d expect.


I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2011, interned for a semester, then moved back to Australia (where I grew up). I spent 3 years there working in digital advertising as a project/account manager, but wanted to get my hands dirty and actually start creating things myself. I moved back to
America in April and took a few months off to visit family and study for HR while I waited for my work permit. Since that arrived, I’ve been doing freelance digital marketing consulting/project management.


Carbondale, IL. Previously Melbourne, Australia.


Consumerfacing products that are enjoyable to use and address a real need for users. Sounds easy, but it goes disastrously wrong all the time (Tidal, Apple Maps, every Blackberry device for the last 5 years).


Not much  just some basic HTML/CSS in college and a weird text adventure game I built in JS.


I love film and TV (majored in Cinema Studies & Media Studies), so I’m always happy to give or receive a recommendation.




Jacques Uys


Firsttname: Jacques (like the weresquirrel || Cousteau) and Surname: Uys (pronouced "Ace").


Was a designer/photographer who started doing web design and coding.
The majority was spent working as a front end developer. Was before joining Hack Reactor, I was part of the UX team for a price comparison website.


Cape Town, South Africa.


My interests in technology are secondary to what it can do for the end user.
I am always gratified by how technology can delight and ease the lifes of others.
As programmers we are empowered to be creators and we can make ideas come to life!


HTML, CSS, some JS, jQuery, PHP, dabble in some Python (nothing serious). Other: Some frameworks, CMS' and libraries (JS and CSS).
 

I love travelling and meeting new people: Mozambique, Namibia, Mauritius, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile, U.K, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands.
English is my second language, "Afrikaans" is my first language.
Phonetically my surname (Uys), sounds like " ice" in Afrikaans. People always make a wide range of jokes, like "Uys, Uys baby" etc. I love doing hikes up Lion's Head mountain
 



Alexxis Johnson


Alexxis Johnson (yes, it's really spelled with two x's!)  it's pronounced liked Alexis, but Siri always pronounces it funny.


I work in marketing for a medical supply company and attend school part time. I haven't made too much progress towards a college degree yet, but I do plan to get one eventually. I also spend a lot of time doing things in the arts (singing, piano, writing, etc.) as well as various physical activities like swimming and yoga. Always busy!


I'm coming from Sunny San Diego!


My favorite thing about tech is how we continue to compact and lessen the need for hardware and bulk. The less money we need to spend updating hefty hardware and the less space we need to store it, the better things are! I'm also interesting in AI and cyber security, but I don't know too much about either. Maybe those are some good learning projects postHR :)


I had never even heard of most programming languages a little over a year ago (I was planning on studying English and foreign languages). I started trying to learn ObjectiveC to build an app right before Swift was released, but I realized I was in way over my head, so I took two intro classes in Java and C++. I also did a few courses online with Udacity for FrontEnd Web Dev, as well as courses on Code School and other free online classes.


My middle name also has two x's  Roxxanne! I also love all pets and am the person who will run over to make friends with a dog on the sidewalk.




Evan Chen


Evan Chen


I graduated from USC with a B.S. in Business Administration in 2011. I've been working at Amazon.com since then in a variety of different roles. I'm currently a Sr. Marketing Manager for A mazon Business, a new marketplace that takes the Amazon.com experience and redesigns it for business customers.


I'm moving from Seattle, but I also grew up nearby in Palo Alto.


I'm particularly interested in the intersection of technology and realworld applications, and how it redefines the world around us (see W hy Software Is Eating The World) .


I took HTML/CSS, Java, and C++ courses in high school, but I didn't become serious about studying CS until after I graduated from college. I've since taken a few online courses (I ntroduction to Computer Science, A lgorithms: Design and Analysis, and S tartup Engineering)  and a SQL course for Amazon employees.


I love to travel. I spent two years living in Taiwan when I was young. I had a summer internship in Shanghai. I also studied abroad for one semester in Budapest. In total, I've been to 21 countries (and counting): Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Croatia, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Montenegro, Netherlands, Serbia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and USA.
I also love to play and watch sports. I'm a big fan of USC football, the 49ers, and the Warriors.




Griffin Michl


Griffin Michl


I spend the past 6 months traveling primarily in Southeast Asia. Before that I spent 2 years doing public health and epidemiology research at a hospital in Boston. Grew up in Boston and graduated with a Math degree from UC Santa Barbara in '13.


Boston


I like data science, but I don't think I have enough exposure to other areas to know in what exactly I'm interested.


Took some classes that used Python and R in college. Selftaught myself more python in order to automated tasks at my research position and eventually developed systems to track and provide feedback to clinical trial participants. Also dabbled in CSS and javascript in order to develop websites for research participants to interact with. Random statistical programming here and there as well.


I love traveling and have visited 12 countries this year. I am also a big skier (though I haven't been yet this year) and usually like to go to the gym, but 6 months of travel has left me painfully out of shape.




Ian deBoisblanc


My name is Ian. Usually I go by Ian, sometimes by E. Or also by I. Whatever works.
Last name is deBoisblanc. It's French. Pronounced like duhbwablanc (that last syllable rhymes with honk without the k and like half the n, or exactly like blanc from Sauvignon Blanc for you winos).


I spent the past year working as a business consultant at a dataanalytics firm. It was a great opportunity, but left me looking for more of a creative outlet. So I took a few months off, did some travel in SE Asia, learned to sew, and built an island for my kitchen.


I've been living in SF for the past year, but I'm originally from New Orleans. I talk about it all the time, so you probably won't forget.


I love all things space relatedit's my dream to see the Earth from outer space before I die. Fingers crossed for space tourism taking off! I'm also fascinated by what people can bring to life by combining art and technology.


I took a java class in school, and have done a bit of Arduino in my free time. Nothing serious, just enough to get excited about it.


I love good beers, tossing frisbee, and park chillin'.




Rohit Mathew


Hi Everyone my name is Rohit Mathew. (Roheet). I go by Rohit but I'll occasionally answer to clever nicknames


I've been working as a software consultant for the past 2 years; doing a mix of business analysis and Java development. I work for a firm that builds IT solutions for our clients on a largescale and also helps with their technology strategy as a whole.


I grew up in the Bay Area but went down to SoCal for college and lived in Atlanta and India since then. I made my way back here a couple years ago and I'm currently living in Fremont, CA.


I've had a passion for technology and tinkering since I was young; pulling open my dad's computer and putting it back together. I
studied mechanical engineering in college with the intention of going into the automotive industry but I found programming and software development more interesting and particularity now with the rise of robotics and AI, I think that software will be a significant component of any engineering disciple in the future. I also love consumer tech and I spend alot of my free time on tech blogs reading about how these devices are changing our lives


Took a C++ course in college, and used Matlab for several classes. Been working with Java and some basic HTML/JS/CSS at my job for the past couple years.


Fun random stuff? 
I love a good book, particularity SciFI or Fantasy, so I've been engrossed in all the Star Wars mania the past couple months. I enjoy hiking and have been trying to explore more of the Bay Area.




Maryam Aljimaz


Maryam Aljimaz


I am a teaching assistant


Kuwait


I graduated from the computer engineering department. I have always enjoyed programming and playing with hardware. I ended up working as a network administrator because it was a
mystery to me, I then shifted to my current job because it offered an opportunity to travel.


C and Java in college and some hardware programming language. Also, used Java and ASP to automate tasks to make sure my network devices were up and running *good old days!* Oh and I have a hate/love relationship with algorithms!


Love to read, love cats, love to go on adventures  last one was skydiving!




Sondra Silverhawk


I'm Sondra Silverhawk.


I studied Environmental Science in college, then went for a PhD in biology, but had to leave the program early because of a death in the family. I was able to finish a masters, and then I took some time off to figure out what I wanted to do next. Academia no longer appealed, there weren't many interesting private sector opportunities for biologists, and I was burnt out on it, anyway. I did some writing, worked as an editor for a while, improved my cooking skills, and taught myself to code. Surprisingly coding was the thing I enjoyed most, and since the job prospects are great, it was the clear winner.


I currently live in Portland.


I'm still exploring all the possibilities. So far I'm really interested in machine learning and natural language processing. I did the machine learning class on Coursera, and it was mindbending. I loved it.


I took a class in grad school that focused on the use of Matlab in biomedical engineering. The professor gave us some code to hack on, and after the class I wanted to learn more so I downloaded Stanford's CS106A, an intro to computer science in Java. After I finished that I went through Learn Python the Hard Way, and did an evening class here in Portland, at Epicodus. At this point I've done the beginner stuff to death, and am looking forward to more advanced challenges at Hack Reactor.


I do a lot of reading and I love to travel. A few years ago I played Earthbound for the first time, and after I beat it I played it through again. The world is so unique, and the game play is simple but satisfying. Since then I've been thinking about making my own oldschool RPG, but too many projects, too little time. I also love Katamari Damacy. It's brilliant.




Max Kroshka


My first name is Maksym, but i go by Max or Maks (which sounds the same, at least to me). Last name is Kroshka, looks complicated but sounds exactly the way it looks.


Back in university my major was International Relationships (which is pretty much a little bit about everything), but i never got to work in that field since i moved to USA. I have 5 years of experience in Hospitality Business working as a server and manager assistant, so it is a big change for me coming into this.


I am originally from Ukraine, moved to NYC when i was 18 and 3 years later moved to San Francisco. I am one of the few lucky people in our cohort who does not have to face a big challenge of moving from another city, getting used to new weather and stuff like that. :)


I would love to work on something that helps people save at least a little bit of their time, cause,
you know, time is a "money". (Replace money with something you value the most)


I studied a little bit of ancient programming languages Turbo Pascal and Delphi back in high school. And some of HTML and CSS in university. Nothing that i could actually remember when i have decided to learn to code 1.5 ago :)
I took lots of online courses on HTML, CSS, JS and tiny bit of Ruby. Then went through HackPrep class here is SF. That's about it.


Sometimes i might sound a little bit cold or mean, but i really don't mean that. There are this big differences between Eastern European and American culture and mentality that i am still trying to get rid off, so please don't mind me :D
I also like great food, sports, beers and travel.




Joe Miller


Joe Miller


I lived abroad until coming back to the US for college. I graduated with a degree in classical guitar in 2013 and have been freelancing music and webpages for the past two years.


Bellingham WA, an hour north of Seattle. It is one of the most rainy
 places in the country.


I have been interested in Bitcoin for a couple of years and would love to do something crypto currency / blockchain related. Also I have a couple of raspberry pis that I fool around with.


HTML, CSS, Foundation5/Bootstrap, a little PHP, and I have done one project using Ruby on Rails. I started with JS a couple of months ago and am really liking it, I also took an online intro to CS course on MITX that used python.


I love to travel and this summer for two months I went to eastern Europe and then over to Spain. I play ultimate frisbee when I can and enjoy classical guitar and piano.




Daniel Wong


Hey everyone! I go by Daniel Wong, although some people call me Danny. Whichever one flows off your tongue more naturally.


I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2014 with a degree in molecular and cell biology. While interviewing at med schools I decided not to pursue that anymore. In the meantime I continued a research project at Berkeley (studied developmental biology... random fact: I worked with frogs and did experiments with their embryos) I was working on since college.


What city are you coming from to be
here at HR?
Born and raised in Fremont, but moved with my family to Hercules, a small city 15 minutes north of Berkeley. Thankfully
there is a bus line 1 minute from my house that brings me straight to SF downtown.


I think self driving cars will be in the spotlight in the next decade.


I learned everything I know from books/internet in the past three months.


I love spending time in cafes or outdoors with my free time. I also spend a lot of time in SF exploring different restaurants with friends. Anything with good company is a great time for me!
 



Siva Periyasamy


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) Sivaguru Periyasamy
Friends call me Shiva. The even more diminutive 'Shiv' works too.


I did med school in India & practiced medicine for 5 years. Been doing a couple of web projects recently.


I'm coming in from Raleigh, NC where
 I've lived since 2013.


Data visualization, Functional Programming (really planning to learn Lisp some day)


Did some coding in high school programming contests (don't remember much now). Then med school intervened. I've been running a Linux server for pet projects for a long time. Some python. HTML/CSS, jQuery for the aforementioned web projects. Decided to do this full time & got serious since July this year, with Eloquent Javascript for company. Love that book by the way. I'm really interested in building tools which help build stuff. Kind of like Underscore.js


Love to read. I like hiking, photography, long drives. Hoping to do something combining all three after the course.
I'm a decent cook and I love dogs.




Erick Paepke


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) Erick Paepke (Pepkee)


I finished my master's degree in structural engineering at UC Berkeley just a couple of weeks ago. I entered my master's program directly after finishing my bachelor's degree in civil engineering at UC Berkeley in 2014.


I moved to Berkeley in August of 2010
 after spending my childhood in Sacramento, CA.


My tech interests are broad, but to name a few: data visualization, machine learning, and AI.


I have basic proficiency in Java and Matlab (including data structures). I've taken a couple of collegelevel courses, and I've done a bit of selfstudying.
This past semester, I was a graduate student instructor for a freshmanlevel Matlab course at Cal.


For a year, I was the construction manager of Cal's concrete canoe team. Annually, the team builds and races a 20ft+ canoe made entirely of concrete and reinforcement!
Some of my interests/hobbies: snowboarding, surfing, longboarding, hiking, biking, and photography




Nick Echols


Nick Echols (EK HOLS)


I've been working as a cook(and a lot of other things) for a small takeout restaurant in Berkeley for the last four years. Also playing in a crappy
rock and roll band at sparsely attended bar shows, and watching better bands perform at better venues :P


Oakland


I'm very interested in using tech in art/music/immersion/entertainment/experience, and other words like that. I would like to help make magical, otherworldly experiences with people who are more artistically creative than I am.
Of course this includes things like arduino, and other stuff that makes flashes and beeps. On a related note, I spend a lot of my free time on instructables
Also, I hope to do notevil (even notdouchey if that's possible) things with my programming skills coming out of HR


I took an intro to computer science course my first quarter of UCSD, fell in love with programming, and did a lot more throughout my time there, minoring in CS. After that, I decided I needed a big change, so I didn't pursue a techrelated career. I did keep learning on my own though, and picked up a few new programming skills and languages on the way. I ultimately decided that I seriously enjoy this stuff and I wanna dive in and actually make a career out of it.


This is the hardest one. Does anyone else feel like they're writing a weird okcupid profile?
  Anyway, I like surfing too, and haven't gone in a tragically long time, so those who mentioned it above (and anyone else too), let's go!




Thomas Hoffman


Thomas Hoffmann


This past Spring I graduated from the University of Maine with a B.S. in Bioengineering. I originally intended to continue on to medical school, but ultimately decided it just wasn’t something I was passionate about. Since then, while halfheartedly applying to a variety of jobs, I started to get more into programming, eventually realizing it was something I wanted to pursue more seriously.


Hampden, Maine (definitely looking forward to the change in weather).


There are many tech areas I find interesting, such as cybersecurity, the intersection of biology and technology, machine learning, gaming, software
development (applications and systems), and augmented reality, among others. I hope to learn more about my interests and hopefully find one I am passionate about.


I began programming near the end college by teaching myself the basics of Python. While I enjoyed it, I never really did much with it. Other than that, the majority of my coding experience has been learning HTML/CSS and Javascript over the past 34 months.

 
I am a very active person and love learning to play new sports (always wanted to surf!). I also like reading, traveling, video games, watching sports, and grabbing a drink with friends.




Jacob Lee


My name is Donghee, but I use Jacob as my english name.


I was in the steel industry when I was in Korea. Since I immigrated to here, I have pursued continuing education and have worked in the
 real estate industry.


I was born and raised in Korea. My current residence is in New York.


I am interested in Finance technology. I am also interested in data visualization, data science. I hope to find discover more about tech via this experience.


I have some programming experience when I was in college, but I forgot everything because It was long time ago. After that I had some experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript through online course.


I love flying and traveling. I am planning on taking classes to obtain a private pilot license in the near future.




Frank Shieh


My name's Franklin Shieh. I go by Frank. Last name is pronounced like "Shay".


I just graduated from USC in December 2015 having studied Business Administration for 3.5 years. I've spent the last two summers interning at Barclays Investment Bank in their Menlo Park Technology Coverage group supporting the team on mergers & acquisitions and capital raises.


I've been living in Los Angeles from 2012now, but I'm originally from Palo Alto.


I think there's still too much about tech that I don't know about, so I can't say for sure what I'm most interested in yet. But at the moment, I'd love to explore more in automation, machine learning, SaaS and the sharing economy (to put it in buzzwords).


Zero; before selfstudying through online resources, the only "coding" experience I had was writing an IF statement in excel and copypasting someone else's VBA code.


I enjoy running/road cycling/weightlifting, so am looking for a workout partner. I sometimes play saxophone/clarinet and am a big fan of jazz music. Also very interested in exploring the city.



 
Veliko Markov


My first name is Veliko [veleeko], last name Markov.


The last four years I spent working in corporate travel.


I was born and raised in Bulgaria. The last five years I have been living in San Francisco.


If we define "tech interest" as something that I like hearing or reading about, then too many. Here are some:
● Any technology that can displace the big banks. ●
● Any technology that can displace oil and coal like nuclear, solar, wind etc. ●
● Everything automotive, especially car design, electric vehicles and selfdriving cars. ●


I did some coding in Pascal back in highschool and found it really interesting. Some experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My main goal with joining Hack Reactor is to finally advance one of my "interests" into a vocation.


If I was left alone on an island with a lot of books and drawing supplies, I would probably fail to notice that people are missing.




Victoria Tran


Hi everyone! My name is Victoria Tran  Pretty
straightforward


I was majoring in psychology at a community college in Orange County, but decided to take a break from school to save up money. I moved up to the bay area about 1.5 years ago & heard about HR through a friend & decided to take the plunge.


Huntington Beach to San Leandro to San Francisco! :)
  Jobwise? As of now, I would like to be making games in the future, but I haven't really exposed myself to all the other options. There's just so many!


Does Xanga count? After I discovered HR, I studied from the ground up for about a year before I felt comfortable applying. Selftaught JS, HMTL, CSS, & some Ruby.


I love reading. Mostly scifi or fantasy, but I'm open to suggestions! I also love singing & playing my ukulele when I have the urge to learn a new song. I started taking Brazilian JiuJitsu classes last year, but ultimately took a break because of work & studies, so I'm excited to get back into it after HR!
COFFEE.. I love coffee!! Tea is cool too

Since graduating college in 2011, I've been working in renewables (energy efficiency,
solar, and wind) and have been coming to terms with the fact I like burritos almost as much as pizza. Sometimes the decision is too overwhelming and I have a milkshake.


Berkeley. I lived in DC for a few years and then moved to Berkeley last fall to be closer to family.


I'm interested in software that makes clean energy cheaper and easier to implement. I'm also interested in machine learning and how it can be used to help the grid be more efficient and integrate with more renewable sources.

B e f o r e t h a t I h a d n o e x p e r i e n c e actually coding, although at my last company I worked with developers to improve our homegrown software. Working with them made me realize I might really enjoy coding.


I love to eat, I love to cook, and I love nearly any outdoor adventure so long as there's a beer at the end of the road.

Studied Architecture at UC Berkeley, then worked in the field for 3 years. Quit in April, but still doing contract work since then.


I've been in Oakland for a few years now. I'll be commuting via BART, from MacArthur station


the Internet of Things, data visualizations (d3!), and anything that will help cities be more sustainable in the wake of the continuing influx of urban populations. AI (and AI r isk! ) is on my radar, though, because of this great WaitButWhy post on S uper Intelligence and why EVERYBODY should care.


Zero, before questioning my career. Did Codecademy,
CodeSchool, FreeCodeCamp, CodeWars, etc. and I'm really excited about creating/building digital spaces!


I love anything outdoors  camping, hiking and swimming in the summer, snowboarding in the winter. I have an awesome rabbit (pet) named Domino. I weld, mostly gas(Oxy/Acetylene) and TIG, and I like to build things.
 



Vince Cipriani


Vince Cipriani (last name has been Americanized to SipReAnnE)


Graduated w/ a BS in Industrial Engineering in 2009. I've been working at a DC IoT startup ever since. First role was managing their supply chain, then business analyst doing a lot w/ SQL and business intelligence. Finally, I transitioned to software engineering about 8 months ago.


Grew up in northern West Virginia. Have lived in the DC metro for the past 6 years.


I have a strong interest in SaaS platforms and building tools to solve real world business problems. In general, I like solving problems and as long as the problem is interesting and worth solving, I can get excited about it.


I planned on attending HR a year ago, but my company let me transition to software so I postponed my enrollment. I've been writing C# and SQL for the past ~8 months. Its been mostly backend work so I'm excited to dive into the frontend.


I got engaged in September; hopefully my fiancee will still be waiting for me when I finish HR. I enjoy hiking, mountain biking and concerts in my spare time.




Jarrett Gliner


Jarrett Gliner  Easy to pronounce, confusing to spell!


I graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 2014, with a BA in Psychology and a minor in Technology Management and Entrepreneurship. I had always known I wanted to work in Tech, and even taught myself a bit of coding in High School, but I was initially more interested in the business/marketing side of the industry. After taking a Python course in college, I realized that coding was actually my passion and that I should have majored in CS all along. Unfortunately, it was too late at that point to change.
After graduating, I went on to work at a Santa Barbarabased midstage startup called FindTheBest (now called Graphiq) as a Product Manager. I was stoked that the role was relatively technical, but after a year of working there, I knew I had to dive headfirst into the real deal and become a developer.


Santa Barbara (grew up in San Diego).


One of my goals in being a developer is to improve how we socialize in the age of “always on” by 1) using technology as a tool for socializing rather than a distraction from it, and 2) giving longtime connections who would not ordinarily interact a more natural way to keep in touch. Expanding on the first point: while it’s disappointing that casual group gettogethers can have periods where everyone is silently checking their phones, there’s more we can do than just removing the phones from the equation. A game like Q uiplash (which I'm always down to play if we ever have time) already does a great job of this, but there are not many other applications that have people interacting in the same way. For the second point, activities such as Fantasy Sports can keep a group connected despite their distance and differing schedules. However, in order to make that possible, everyone in the group must have a mutual interest in the sport, so there is room to expand that concept as well.


I taught myself HTML/CSS and took a class in Python. At FindTheBest, my role required me to learn mySQL/Database management and basic JS, as well as a funky “visualprogramming” application called Pentaho Data Integration (imagine a highlevel language like Python or JS, but instead of typing code, you drag and connect boxes on a grid that represent various functions).


I’m into pretty much any hobby that involves creativity. Whether it’s playing/producing music, cooking, writing, messing around in Photoshop, or even video games, I love turning nothing into something. Besides that, I’m a Football nut (even though being a Chargers fan is... difficult at times). Also, I’m all about craft beer and whiskey.




Anthony Salierno


Anthony Salierno. I don't really pronounce the "i" in my last name, so I say it like suhLAIRno.


Most recently I worked as an analyst at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund in Westport, CT. Prior to that I worked as an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, an investment bank in New York City. Before that I graduated from Villanova University in 2010 having majored in finance and accounting. I knew finance wasn't what I really wanted to do longterm and after becoming more and more obsessed with tech and the future every day for the past few years I finally found out about Hack Reactor and was ecstatic to follow a path that made sense to me.
 

I moved from NYC where I've lived for the past five years since graduating from college.


1.) Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 2.) Human Longevity and Medical Innovation 3.) Space Exploration and Colonization
I'm really interested in being part of building a better future. People have never been more empowered than now to take part in improving the world and I want to make a contribution that I'm proud of. If anyone is interested in the future and what it might look like I plan on starting a meet up group in SF after Hack Reactor ends (when we have lives again haha) for entrepreneurially minded people who think longterm so I hope to see some of you there!


I basically started from scratch to get into Hack Reactor. I had tried a Swift course a year earlier but didn't stick with it because I couldn't make time.


I enjoy working out and have become a big fan of meditation and yoga over the past couple of years. I'm also very interested in the future of humanity, the universe / space, evolution and psychology.




Joshua Sheller


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed  it helps so much!) Joshua Sheller. Most call me Sheller, but Josh or Joshua are both just as well to me.


I graduated from Pepperdine University with a Business Major and Applied Math Minor in 2012. For the past couple of years I’ve been running a lab for a startup working to perfect a process dealing with fractional distillation and gas chromatography (just a fancy way of saying separating and analyzing oils we are distilling). Fingers crossed some of our work will make a real difference for those fighting multiple sclerosis, alzheimer’s, certain types of cancer, and some other very ugly stuff.


I was born and raised in a small town in Iowa, moved to CA for college, and have been back and forth between the east
and west coast a few times since. I’m currently coming from visiting family in Mason City, Iowa.


After reading about / playing around with some Javascript and Ruby/Rails I realized that the numbers we put together through excel sheets in our most recent lab work (which took us several months) could have been analyzed in days, minutes, or less. Blew my mind! I’m fascinated by the ability of 20 lines of code to reach 20 million people and can’t wait to learn more about data analysis, and any other area of Javascript with the potential to make a positive dent in the universe!


After college I helped build the “coding” side of my sister’s startup (Nearly Newlywed  check us out on Shark Tank!). This was mostly only html/css with a bit of the Shopify templating language Liquid. I also recently finished a very rough first draft of a poker odds training / analysis “app” if anyone is into cards. That is about it, so I’ll be playing catch up with all of you.


I love to backpack and explore the world / other ways of life. I enjoy reading / hiking / lifting / anything active. I try to surround myself with people smarter than me, and I’ve just met forty plus of you, so I look forward to learning from all of you!




Orlando Castillo


Orlando Castillo (The double L's in my last name are pronounced like a Y). My nickname is Lance, and a lot of my friends call me that, but Lance or Orlando (or any other variant of that, I get Lando sometimes from Star Wars fans) is good with me!  


I just graduated this past May from University of Pennsylvania with a degree in Biophysics. Since then, I have been working as a Research Technician at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania on a project involved in the creation of an "artificial womb" for premature babies. While working there, my main responsibilities involved improving their data management and analysis for the project, using VBScript, HTML, some JavaScript, and Excel to streamline their data input and subsequent calculation process. I also had to help take care of the baby lambs they were using to model a human fetus. I used to be Premed, but my persistent hobby for topics in computer science along with the work I've been doing as a member of this research team has reinforced the idea that a career in computer science may be more suited to my passions and talents than one in medicine!


Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (I've lived here all my life, so I'm really excited to live in a new environment!)


I've always been interested in computer science. When I was younger, I was really interested in trying to build an iPhone App, so I learned C on my Macbook and then ObjectiveC before playing around with Cocoa to build very basic apps. Later on in college, I would often take study breaks by taking courses on Codeacademy or reading online about some computer topic simply because it allowed my mind to switch gears from whatever I was studying at the moment and I always found the content stimulating. Lately, I've been trying to play around with Linux distros, it's my first time using them so right now I'm running an Ubuntu distro.


I taught myself C and ObjectiveC in high school. I took an intro to Computer Science Course as an undergraduate where I learned some Java. A lot of my physics classes required me to program in Matlab with some Python occasionally thrown in as part of my studies. I've been studying codeacademy and, in order to write scripts with the software my research team uses for data capture, I've learned VBscript, HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Lastly, recently I've started teaching myself Haskell, because as a functional programming language it requires you to think differently about how you write programs and I think that adopting a different perspective in the way you program can be helpful to solving problems. Additionally, from what I hear, there seems to be a lot of talk about functional programming vs. imperative programming, so I feel like having a bit of experience with both can be valuable.


I'm a pretty big Star Wars fun, so I've really been enjoying all the hype that's coming back to the stories with the new movie that came out. I also recently started to engage in a more active lifestyle so I always try and work out every day. Lastly, I'm a big reader, so I always enjoy talking about a good book or new novel if anyone every has any suggestions. I'm so excited to meet everyone and look forward to staying in SF!




Kyle Corbelli


Hi everyone, my name is Kyle Corbelli. Nothing crazy about the pronunciation.


Working, hiking, surfing, coding, road tripping (I'm typing this right now in a cozy snowcovered bungalow in Utah). But as far as all the professional stuff goes, I started working as an actuarial analyst right out of college and somehow found my way into sales. It's been fun but I'm not quite extroverted enough to want to pack in 30 years of that whole thing.


I spent my first couple decades living the Bay Area (Petaluma then Berkeley then Oakland) but have most recently been living in San Diego. It'll be weird at Hack Reactor to be the only guy in the cohort coming from Southern California who likes to hike and surf.


A few concrete topics I think I might enjoy include data science, modeling, machine learning, building tools, and wellintentioned applications aimed at making people happy. Really though, I just like developing software applications. I like the process itself: the focus, the freedom, the challenge, the creation, the headphones, the coffee.


I majored in Math at Cal with a concentration in Stat so I had a lot of fun with Matlab, R, and C. My first realworld "program" was a data analysis and visualization tool I wrote in VBA during an actuarial internship. What I wouldn't give to see that mess of code today. Over the past year or so I've been teaching myself the web technologies, built a couple things for work, and deployed a little mobilefriendly MEANstack web app that I use in my daytoday. For the last few weeks I've been working through a book on Java to up my OO game and get some experience with a statically typed language.

Liz Mallalieu


Elizabeth Mallalieu. Most people call me Liz, but anything works :)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor? I graduated from Colgate University in 2013 with a degree in Economics, but decided to go a different route after college working for a small electronic music startup doing a little bit of everything from editorial and content creation to media partnerships with festivals and event ticketing. The website didn’t work very well causing a lot of problems for us, so I ended up learning a bit about the web. After that, I decided I wanted to move to the engineering side of startups and started to learn coding on my own. During this time, I did an internship at Foursquare in product ops, which solidified my desire to become a full time programmer.


NYC. I’m definitely looking forward to escaping the cold winter this year!


I have recently become interested in blockchain technology, specifically the ways it can be applied to so many different industries. It’s a really interesting time to become a programmer, and I’m excited to be a part of it!


I did some very basic programming in SAS and Stata to work with data sets for an econometrics course in college, but didn’t do much beyond that until I started exploring the many online resources about a year ago to see if coding was something I actually wanted to pursue as a career. I didn’t get too serious with it until this summer, when I took Hack Reactor Remote Prep, and studied for the Hack Reactor interview process.


I love music and going to shows, and I am a hockey fan (go Rangers!). I love exploring new cities so I’m looking forward to getting to know SF with all of you. Hopefully we won't be too busy/wiped out to hang out together on Sundays!




John Domingo


John Domingo (as in Sunday)


What have you been up to before Hack Reactor? Studied Marine Science at UC Berkeley until 2013 and then applied to work at a small geology lab. Although I didn’t have any of the technical skills to be an analyst, they hired me anyway to help with some data entry and marketing projects. I spent the last two years working my way up as the database administrator and now I’m primarily lab software consultant. Small company though
so there’s a bit of title inflation I guess :p


I've live in Dogtown, Oakland for a little over two years now :) Originally from San Diego!


I’m interested in data viz, WebGL, machine learning, robotics, mobile dev, and data science. I’m having a blast learning frontend technologies because my current job as a DBA has me looking at tables and tables for days.


Basic HTML when Xanga was around; Java in high school (although I only retained the OOP concepts); MATLAB and Scheme (dialect of Lisp) in college; and Basic, SQL, Visual Basic + VBA (Access, Excel and Outlook) for work.


I like to cook and bake a lot, although most times it’s a hit or miss :p I really enjoy CrossFit and boxing so I’m a bit sad that I’m going to have to scale back once HR starts. If anyone else is interested, we should keep each other in check! I will be aiming for the 7am classes near 19th street BART on weekdays. I also like to run around Lake Merritt every Sunday :)
