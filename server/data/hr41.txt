I graduated with a business degree from UC Berkeley in 2013. After that, I worked at eBay/PayPal for about 2 years. I left in December to join HR!


I'm coming from Hayward just 30 minutes away!
￼

I really want to explore artificial intelligence and machine learning.


While I was at Berkeley, I took a few programming courses in Python, C++, and Java. Also, I built an WiFi enabled, LED lamp (kind of like the Phillips Hue) and built a website to control it. At eBay, I had a nontechnical business role, but I was given an opportunity to make small changes to internal web apps.


I love making music I used to play clarinet in the Cal Marching Band, and now I'm experimenting with electronic music.

I'm taking a year off from college. I've been trying to learn iOS and enjoying the soon-to-be-ended luxury of going to bed at 4am and sleeping past noon.


New Haven, CT


I know very little about specific fields in tech, but overall anything that makes people's lives better or more interesting. I think VR goggles are awesome!


A little bit of Python and Swift. Also very basic Stata learned in an econometrics class. Aversion to CSS.


I'd like to have at least two cats. I'd also like to travel more once I'm able to support myself. However, not all flights and hotels are pet friendly. Ugh we'll see.

I graduated from NYU in May, philosophy with a chem minor, and have been pretty much prepping for HR since then.


Irvine, CA, a suburb about an hour south of LA


It might seem a little overplayed at this point but I think bitcoin is pretty neat.


Not much before May, I do play lots of video games though :D


I cut my hair about a month ago for the first time since summer 2013 to clean up for HR.




Chris Johnson


I'm Chris Johnson.
the pronunciation is pretty straightforward: k-ris john son Just Chris is fine though.


Before HR, I majored in Biochemistry at Colorado College.
After graduation I found a job in Pharma manufacture.
I went from that to the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. My experience with research made me want to do something else for a career and I studied programming for the last year to prepare for this boot camp.


My last move was from Denver, CO. I'm interested in VR and its potential￼￼as an educational tool.


My coding experience comes from a year of self-study and the telegraph-prep course. I can't wait to see what I can do at the end of this class.


I'm always looking for a challenge, especially learning new skills.
If you've got an obscure talent I'll probably bug you for a lesson at some point.


My love of doing anything active outside is constantly at war with my love of video games, sci-fi and fantasy.

I am coming from Binghamton, NY. Its a small Upstate NY town but was once home of IBM!


I am really interested in using technology to enable healthy lifestyles. I am curious about the Quantified Self movement and would like to eventually learn machine learning techniques and apply them to behavioral data.


I have dabbled in Python with pandas, matplotlib and Jupyter over the last couple of years. Went to my University's hackathon and had a great time trying to build an app, which my roommate did most of the work as he was a CS PhD student. The language that I am currently most comfortable with is JavaScript.


I love having deep conversations about all sorts of things from the mind to Elon Musk to the future to politics or really anything. I chronically work out and love music of all sorts. Listening to The Steve Kimock Band as I type this!




Brandon Ramirez

Traveling... backpacking South America. Climbing in different parts of Texas, Colorado (and also Ecuador which was awesome). Before that leading product for 2+ years at a tech startup that I co-founded with a friend from college. Prior to that I worked as a PM at Microsoft and lived up in Seattle. I'm from Southern California originally.


Austin, TX


Interested in "universal" JavaScript, React, machine learning, connected devices.


I took a data structures class in college and it was easily my worst subject (I never once was in the same room as a professor AND a computer at the same time)... I've been working around brilliant software engineers for the last ~5 years though, so have picked up some by way of osmosis, and this time around am enjoying coding a lot more!


Hmmm... I'm a fan of learning/ trying new things, so I tend to read a lot. One random thing I never thought I would try was this past year I learned swing dancing and "two-step" so I could non-ironically have fun at some of Austin's local favorite bars. I also recently tried out MIG welding and milling (manual, not CNC) which were both pretty cool.

Alexander Turinske


Alexander (al-ex-an-der) James (jay-ms) Turinske (tur-in-ski)


Everything that I was up to before Hack Reactor?!?! Okay; I'll give it a shot: born on June 5, 1989 as the youngest of two, had a childhood full of horses, in middle school I was the kid wearing only clothes that were made from wind-breaker material, crashed a car when I was in high school so I had an excuse to be late for school, went to college for physics, worked in technical support for ~2yrs for an industrial automation distributor, and am now freezing in Wisconsin waiting for HR to start.


Milwaukee, WI


I was really into hardware and built computers, but as technical support, I did some work with firmware and controlling hardware via the internet, which I think is neat. Interested in web applications that interact with/control hardware. Also databases sound pretty alright in my book.


One semester of Visual Basic five years ago and I was teaching myself Java before hearing about HR and switching to JS. I probably know just as much about Java as I know about JS right now; maybe I should make Android Apps? Idk.


Here are some random things about me: I like running, hiking, bicycling, kayaking, bouldering, and camping, I don't like baking because I am bad at it, I have just recently gotten really good at headstands, I listen to music, but am terrible at remembering lyrics, and I made non-bag popcorn on the stovetop for the first time last night.

Berkeley, CA


I'm pretty broad in my interests, nothing specific. What I really like is the process of creative problem solving!


A while ago I had job doing some VBScript coding for a year and I have been coding as a hobby every since. I also have some experience with PHP, Javascript, MySql and a little Linux administration.


In addition to playing Guitar and Fiddle, I play the Swedish Nyckelharpa. I mostly play for Contra Dances and Irish Dances locally.

Reid Greer


Reid Greer (Yep, like read a book).


Practicing! But before that, I've worked in a slew of industries, such as service, marketing, and heavy industry. Doing everything from grunt work to small and medium size team management. Worked for several years doing HTML templates and managing CMSs.


Chillicothe, IL. It's a tiny town next to Peoria, IL. And if you don't know where that is...about 2 hours from Chicago :)


I hold front end stuff near and dear. So UI and UX are some of my favorite topics. But AI and deep learning are some concepts I'd like to explore more.


I have a deep love of HTML and CSS, no matter what anyone says! I've also got a (very minimal) working knowledge of PHP and MySQL.


I'm certified to manage a restaurant anywhere in the U.S., and also able to train people for basic food safety! Oddly enough, I'm still a terrible cook.




Lizzy Harris

I studied literature and French in college. I starting getting into journalism and discovered data￼visualization along the way. So I tacked on a CS minor to my English degree. After graduating this past June I worked for a company called Girls Who Code and now I am here!


Originally from a town in Northern California close to Tahoe --> Santa Cruz, --> lived in Paris for a bit, --> currently living in San Francisco.


Data visualization is pretty cool. I'm into visual storytelling. Nytimes interactive news desk and FiveThirtyEight make beautiful things. I still appreciate calculators. I like my iphone.


A minor in CS, dabbled in a lot of things to complete that: C, Java, Python, D3.js, Assembly Language (my worst nightmare), Android, Natural Language Processing, nothing in javascript or much web before I discovered HR!


I really like taking pictures. I also like books: David Sedaris is a genius. I paint sometimes. My birthday was yesterday! I listen to massive amount of podcasts weekly. I like blueberries and pickles and I probably drink too much sparkling water.

I love traveling (domestic & international). I recently returned from The Netherlands where I visited a small town called Geldrop. Apparently, in the mid 90s Geldrop decided to renovate the district when someone noticed the streets formed a ring-like pattern. Many new street names were needed, so they named all of the streets after Lord of the Rings characters: ie. Gandalf, Saruman, Aragorn.




Kim Curran


Kim Curran [pronounced CUR RIN]


I graduated from Boston College back in May with a degree in Marketing and realized I didn't want to do anything related to it. So, I traveled to Hong Kong and Hawaii, then moved to SF in August. Somehow I got roped into making a website for a film festival out here, even though I had no clue how to. Right around that time I started to seriously look into HR and some other programming bootcamps.


Already in San Francisco :)


User experience. Web design. Quite frankly I just love the prospect of being able to conceptualize and bring ideas to life.


Not much beyond frantically teaching myself HTML and CSS back in August.


I was born in Hong Kong and lived there for eight years growing up. Unfortunately I still can't speak Mandarin or Cantonese for the life of me, but I did get a chance to meet Jackie Chan one time.
I went on a yoga retreat the other week and I've never been hungrier in my life.
