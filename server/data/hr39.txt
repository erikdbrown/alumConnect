I feel like my tech interests are constantly changing, but I am currently interested in making new/innovative web apps and mobile apps that help assist in problems we face every day.


I got my BS in Computer Science. Only took one course in web development in college and it actually was one of my favorite courses. Looking forward to diving into the web dev field!


I like going to concerts to see my favorite artists while also discovering new ones! I am quite proud of my vinyl record collection but unfortunately had to sell my record player to pay for tuition. With whatever free time I have left, I like to work on my car (that is completely torn apart in my garage and looks nothing like a car).

Chris Bassano


Chris Bassano (BuhSsahno)


Served a rough 2.5 years doing implementation for Epic (largest enterprise EMR in US by patient population). I wasn't allowed to touch hard code and I wasn't allowed to crosstrain into a more technical role. The consultant lifestyle was fun, but being on the road every other week was stressful and took a
￼toll on my mental and physical health.


From my hometown  White Plains, NY (the burbs). Lived in Madison, WI for a few years after college. Went to school in Ithaca, NY.


I have many interests that I've yet to explore but fully intend to vet during and after HR: Cryptography, blockchain, and mobile app development. Hardware (from microcontrollers to skateboarding equipment). Would love to explore the intersection of tech and human evolution (transhumanism) and develop tech to further the human condition. Also have some valuable experience in Healthcare tech and I believe I can positively contribute to that industry. I want more experience with UX/UI and designing clean, intuitive applications.


Spent 2+ years as a technical PM for a large software company, so I've worked through all stages of the development cycle from initial implementation to live end user training to writing dev specs. Coding experience is lacking but I'm eager to get my fingers dirty.


Used to be an avid downhill longboarder. I started the Cornell Longboarding club and worked with local skate companies to get sponsorships for our riders. I've participated in the "Broadway Bomb" four times. It's an illegal 7mile race through Manhattan traffic. The race's slogan is "You Could Die." Highlights include getting slammed by an SUV, watching a girl get run over by a bus (she survived), bodyslamming a cop (she jumped out right in front of me and tried to trip me), and scaring the sh** out of my mom year after year.
I love pho.




Vincent Pham


Vincent Pham


Before Hack Reactor, I was taking some classes at CC to prepare for grad school for CS. After hearing about HR from a friend, I decided to go this route instead since it is way more time and cost effective. Currently, I have a couple PT jobs to fund this adventure!
￼A few coding classes here and there (Java, C++, MySQL).


I will be coming from the lovely mushroom town of Morgan Hill.


I am interested in the connection between art and technology; you can do some really beautiful stuff with coding! At the moment, I am working on an infinity mirror using an Arduino and LED strips.


I spend way too much time playing League of Legends.
I like turtles.
I am one of many directors for an amazing nonprofit called San Jose Project (s​jproject.org)​.




Gar Lee


Gar Lee


I've been working as a research technician for a pharmaceutical testing laboratory. I'm essentially a QC technician, where my responsibility is to ensure samples are tested and recorded according to the company's procedures.


I'm born and raised in Seattle, WA and this will be my first time in SF! Very excited to start a new journey with all of you!


I've been a diehard FPS gaming fan for as long as I can remember, but lately my tech interests pertain more to mobile apps, and how they give smartphones more smarts. It's mind boggling how none of this even existed no more than 7 years ago, so I'm really eager to gain knowledge to hopefully impact our future.


Didn't even know what coding was until I saw a coworker from IT configure some lab equipment using matlab. Started reading more and more, and here I am today. Preparing for HR has been the sum of all my coding experience thus far.
￼￼

I love ALL sports, and can talk/debate about it for hours at a time. I'm very easily scared, and cannot watch horror movies
Naruto is my all time favorite anime.
passenger service and air cargo.

​For the past five years, I've been a manager at a popular big box retail store. It's the the one with the dog (nice pic Damon).


​Toledo, OH  Born here, but only lived a few years here. Previously Albany, NY.


​Green energy, entertainment, and anything Elon Musk has touched lately.


​Some C++ in high school/college. Some scripting and SQL work with tinyMUX. I left Albany and came back to Toledo in 2014 to go back to school, and
that's when I did some research and found out about HR. In the interim I've learned enough HTML/CSS/PHP to build a storefront for a small business using stripe as the payment gateway.


I have two cats, Kirk and Bones. They will not be joining me in SF until I settle in for good. :c I make my own beef jerky and I've brewed my own beer! Love to cook / mix drinks.
I dyed my hair blue for a while, just to see what people would say.

Boya Jiang


Preferred name (first and last, and proper pronunciation for either or both if needed - it helps so much!)
My name is Boya Jiang, pronounced Boya, Jiyong. People call me Boya or just B if they're lazy.


I've been practicing law for 3 years in FL and been working on the same mass pharm litigation case for the past year. I've
￼studied philosophy since college and love discourse.


Beautiful South Florida, but NYC area born and raised.


I'm interested in cutting edge stuff, be it VR/AR tech, nanomachines, AI, quantum computing, disruptive tech, etc.


Played around with qbasic, C, TI82s as a kid, and recently, the preparation for HR application. 


I love playing and watching basketball. I'm also an avid skier, longboarder and surfer. I consider myself a cinephile and bibliophile and am probably the biggest nerd I know (for now, lol)

I was working for an IT company called Inflection Point Systems that is based in Monterrey, México.


I'm coming from a small town in Mexico called Obregón City, I'm really excited to arrive to San Francisco!


Web development, robots and the videogame industry. I think the videogame industry can do so much better.


I worked as a Junior Developer for 6 months.
I was also working in a robot controlled with smartphones and was coding the iOS and Android apps in Objectivec and Java.

I was working for a commercial concrete contractor in Concord.


Bay Area native! born and raised in San Jose


mainly app and web dev.


nothing before the decision to study for Hack Reactor.


I'm into those predominantly Asian sports (badminton/dragon boat) - powerlifting enthusiast (looking for a gym buddy), 
currently binge watching parks and rec!




Brian Ronaghan


People call me Brian, unless I’m being an ass, and then they use expletives.


Most recently working for the NPR business show "Marketplace." In past lives I've worked as an assistant in hollywood and written the story and dialogue for video games.
 

Los Angeles. (Only lived there about three years. Previously a New York City area lifer.)


I'm fascinated by the way technology changes culture and the economy. It's a cycle that's been going on since before the industrial revolution, but from everything I can see, this time is different. The internet and mobile tech has transformed everything from the way we do business to the way we relate to our loved ones to the very way we think. I'm convinced Peter Thiel is correct when he says "software is eating the world," and so it seems to me the only reasonable thing is to learn how to make it.
I also love any cool gadgets and am interested in machine learning, though I haven't delved into the details.


High school and a little college comp sci in C++ (fun times). Dabbled in Java when working in video games, but really only to understand what I could ask the engineers to do for me. Rediscovered coding recently in JS and have found it fun to struggle with problems and deeply satisfying to solve them.


 l​ove watching baseball and football/playing golf, tennis and baseball badly
 I'm an equal opportunity nerd: I can go equally deep on Star Wars, Gilmore Girls or pro sports. It's a contradictory mix of interests that confuses even me.
 voracious reader, but that will probably go on hold during HR.
 I'm terrible with names but excellent with details, so I will probably know you deeply as a person before I can easily recall your name. So a lot of: "But your sister's exhusband spent a year abroad in Australia during college, didn't he, ummm... Ralph? Sarah? Who are you?"




Steffen Baumgarten


Steffen (the „f“ sharp, no Steven„v“) Baumgarten


I finished my studies in business administration combined with information technology engineering last year. During the times of studies I started all kinds of fun projects like student parties, a fantasy soccer betting platform and an online dating platform for german people 40+. My most serious project, for which I kept working after finishing uni as well, was a company which provided products in the FinTech area, namely direct financing loans for products and services at the point of sale.


Berlin, Germany


Right now I am looking into two fields most.. (1) How can tech (especially mobile) help people to meet their friends, especially increase meetings by chance or meetings with several people (with different and full schedules) and (2) possibilities of how augmented reality can revolutionize the way of teaching and learning


Some Java at uni and all the self taught stuff before applying for HR


I am not particularly good at mini golf. There was a nice and sunny day back in 2008 in a little town in the south island of New Zealand though, when the luck was really on my side.. Since then, whenever tourists are coming by in this little town and decide to play a round of mini golf at the local mini golf place, they may wonder who this Steffen Baumgarten is dominating the local hall of fame at that place.

Diamond Wheeler


Diamond Wheeler (Diamond, pronounced like the stone)


I’m a biologist, and currently working in a cancer research lab at UCSF. Even though I love the subject, bench work (aka pipetting and carrying out experiments) is a little slow pace and antisocial for me. I’ve been passionate about disease research for a pretty good chunk of my life and I would love to stay in the context of disease if possible.


I’m one of the lucky ones that are already in San Francisco. Good luck to everyone looking￼for places to stay, I know it’s rough :[


I’m interested in the code/algorithms behind more permanent medical devices like glucose monitors, insulin pumps, pace makers, etc. These make it possible for people to live more carefree lives despite their conditions. I would love to integrate biology with tech to create/improve on these amazing bionic organs! Since most of these devices are starting have wifi and bluetooth features, security has also become an interesting problem (you don’t want anyone to hack your pace maker...).


I took a class on java in college for fun. I’ve also done a tiny bit of python for my research (mostly just to save myself a few hours doing mindless work) and mainly all the HR prep!


I fenced for 13 years, so think twice before criticizing my code >:]




Arthi Palaniappan


Arthi Palaniappan (Aarthee)


Before Hack Reactor, I spent a few years researching neurological diseases. I was essentially responsible for genetic testing and analysis.


Pleasanton, CA.


Web development and mobile app development.
I am also interested in exploring the application of technology in healthcare industry.


Some C++ in high school and undergrad.
I have been learning Python before Hack Reactor preparation.


Love music DIY projects




Robert Boggs


My name is Robert Boggs but call me Boggs.


Before Hack Reactor, I was working in finance for a biotech company.


I've lived in San Francisco for a year but I grew up in Thousand Oaks.


I'm interested in how tech is changing finance and healthcare.


I built a few VBA projects to automate some of my Excel work. Other than that mainly studying in preparation for HR.


I love to cook and travel and late night ramen.
￼



Linda Zou


My name is Ye Zou, but please call me Linda.


I lived in San Diego for 5 years where I graduated with a major in Environmental Engineering. I'm back in the Bay Area and have recently been dabbling in project management and design as a mechanical engineer for a solar thermal manufacturing company.


I'm currently residing in the Bay area where I grew up and splitting my time between Oakland and Union City.


In addition to developing the skills required to be a software engineer, I am interested in learning and playing with the DIY electronics platforms such as raspberry pi and arduino. I am also very drawn to the concepts and applications of sustainable energy and its impact on the both developed and developing communities.


I don't have any real coding experiences or training. I took a random C class in college as part of my major requirement before they decided to phase it out the following quarter. Apart from the topics covered in the HR prep, I also tried to teach myself a bit of python and ruby earlier this year.


I like throwing and catching frisbees. =)
I have 4 dogs, none of whom understand the concept of playing fetch.
I've just recently finished my precourse and have developed a slight dependency on coffee in the process.

Pavel Parshakov


Pavel Parshakov (first name pronounced as pAvl and rhymes with gravel; pronunciation of last name is unknown to this day). At Starbucks, I usually go by Ryan, Kyle or Sheldon. Over the phone, my name is usually recorded as Pablo, Vavel or Babel. I can go by any name as long as it is used consistently.


I worked as a data analyst for a financial company until March, then I accidentally clicked on Steve Jobs commencement address video on youtube and decided to quit. After burning through most of my savings, I now have a much better understanding of "hungry and foolish”.
Since then I traveled the US a little bit and got somewhat interested in how things are made. Right after failing my first tech interview at HR, I went to China to attend a huge trade show called Canton Fair and visit local manufacturing plants. I came to realize how easy it is for anybody to design and manufacture a product. You can literally draw something on a napkin, pay somebody on Fiver $50 to create a CAD design, send it to a factory in China, get the first prototype two weeks later for the cost of the mould and shipping, and then place a final order once you are satisfied with the finished product. I also realized that most products sold in the US and made in China cost about 10 to 20% of the US price to manufacture.
After China, with my second HR interview coming up, I focused exclusively on chapter 5 of Eloquent Javascript and mastered the .map function in just a few weeks, because while I do believe that failing fast is good, I wanted to at least get to see what the HR program was about and for that I needed to fail slowly.


I am coming from Atlanta, GA, where it’s still possible to own a 4bedroom house for under $900 in mortgage and taxes. In SF, I am looking forward to sharing a onebedroom apartment with 4 roommates for the same price.


I am interested in any technology that can improve lives of people on a large scale. If I were smart enough, these would be the areas of interest:
1) Healthcare  imaging devices (like this one h​ttp://www.wired.com/2014/11/butterflynetwork/)​, health monitoring, medical data repository, CRISPR, and cost transparency.
2) Social  finding a way to make it easier for people to gather and maintain a community. I think outside of big cities, it’s really difficult to keep a real connection with people due to the way communities were set up (this is a good but unorthodox video on the topic: https://www.ted.com/talks/james_howard_kunstler_dissects_suburbia)​. I don’t think facebook and upcoming facebook VR can really replace facetoface interaction and for some reason it is still very difficult to organize a meeting faster than a week or two in advance (the m​eetup.com model).
3) Education  we need more of HRtype learning available across different fields. It should not take a 4year degree to change or acquire a career because this creates a lot of inefficiency.
Having mentioned all of this, I will probably end up in tech support at a local social security office.


I used Excel and SQL every day in my previous job. Also, a long time ago I got a university degree that was a mix of mathematics and computer science. I was not good at either, but did some programming in now extinct Delphi language.


I am a minimalist and everything I own fits into a carryon bag.




Tiffany Thong


Tiffany Thong (last name, pronounce the 'th' as in 'thing', unless that makes you feel uncomfortable)


Had planned on attending medical school and worked in clinical trials for retinal diseases. My working experience helped me realize that I didn't want to work in the clinical setting.


Los Angeles, CA


I love seeing the way tech allows users and businesses to operate on a much more efficient level and improve communication. I have several interests that are quiet random such as:
1) health, one of the reasons my last job frustrated me to no end was how outdated most healthcare providers EHR system/software are. I believe it's a sector that still has a lot of need for innovation and production. There's so much potential to transform the health experience in patient care provided it adopts better tech.
2)data science, I love data.
3)fashion, personal longtime interest of mine. I would love to work for a fashion startup/company (eg: something like polyvore before it got bought out by Yahoo).
 Prep for HR.


I can speak conversational Spanish, learned to apply what I learned in school towards Spanishspeaking patients.
I love sushi, I can eat it everyday. (if anyone from the bay area knows a great sushi spot, let me know!)
I'm trying to teach myself how to memorize people's names really quickly, as I know this will be a useful skill during the first week in HR.




Saumitra Saha


My first name is hard to pronounce, but it is easier if you think of it as “ShowMEThrow”
Three easy english words back to back, make the name easy to pronounce: “Show,” “Me,” and “Throw.”


I was a caregiver the last few years as both of my parents had cancer. But in terms of training, I am an economist.


I am coming from Houston Texas, the city of the 2nd tech boom (the first was Los Alamos during WW2). We live here since my father was
involved in the shuttle program. I lived in the Bay Area over a decade ago. It was not cheap then either.


I am interested in how we can use technology to help people do the things that they want to do. I want to use technology to help people become aware of how much technology they use. I don’t want people to feel that they are controlled by technology. For instance, people talk about how they are addicted to Facebook.


Mainly using statistical software. I have done a few online courses as well. But if I had to pick a language that I am most comfortable in, that would be C.


 I have lived in Chicago, San Francisco, London, Austin, Toronto, and Houston.
I am NOT a competitive person, and I prefer working with people rather than against them. I enjoy teaching.
I like playing soccer or any sports outside. I find that playing outside with friends is a great way to relax, but it is also really hard to get people to join in.




Joey Chin


 Joey Chin, here! Last name is pronounced like you would think. Chinny, chin chin!


 I was web developer/master for a tech company in Los Angeles, and an inner city youth worker in my spare time, meaning I lived and worked in a more￼underserved part of Long Beach to work with the youth.


 Coming from Long Beach, CA! The LBC, Snoop Dogg!! Close to LA.


 Still discovering these, but I do love the problem solving aspect in programming solutions. Would love to learn ways to integrate helping underserved, lowincome communities and tech.


 Creating HTML, CSS, and JS at my former work place, and PHP on a CRM side project.


 I love all sports! I'm an avid FC Barcelona fan, love rock climbing, and can't wait to catch some Steph Curry action when I'm up in the Bay. We probably won't have much time, but hit me up if you plan on playing any kind of sport!




Alice Yu


Alice Yu, pronounced how it looks. "Yu" is like "You."


 I was Director of Community at M​eteor,​a nontechnical role in a very technical company. Meteor was a big part of my inspiration to learn programming and JavaScript in particular. I was at Meteor for 2.5 years, beginning as employee #7 as a junior community manager, m o v i n g i n t o a p r i m a r i l y c​o n t e n t ​r o l e l a t e r , a n d￼finally becoming a director with a team of two people.
In a past life, I studied renewable energy, sustainable transportation, and the electrical grid, and attempted to found several illfated startups. My wouldbe products included a new type of solar cooker to help replace woodburning in developing countries, rentable napping pods, and a digital sheet music reader.


I'm lucky... been living in SF for about 3 years, and am currently in a nice classic SF house a block from the 24th and Mission BART. I'll probably host an event there on the occasional Sunday, if you want to check it out!


I'm excited about cellphones "leapfrogging" into developing countries, opening the doors for things like mobilebased financial services (e.g. M​Pesa)​. ​Project Loon​is inspiring. I'm also excited about electric cars, selfdriving cars, and related opportunities for cleaner, smarter cities.
I believe AI is going to be a big deal, and am curious about VR/AR, wearables, and personalized health.


CS101 in college (Java and Matlab). Took part in a Meteor "app week" in late 2013, during which I built this rudimentary 2D R​ubik's cube simulator.​In June, I decided to m​ake a habit​of programming, and began studying the Hack Reactor resources.


For about 10 months, I lived in a​yurt that I built​out of foam boards and tape, in a friend's backyard. I've previously also lived in a backyard tent, a walkin closet, and in many different hackerhouses / intentional communities.
 I l i k e c o m m u t i n g v i a e l e c t r i c l o n g b o a r d . I n t ​h i s v i d e o , ​ t h a t ' s m e i n t h e b l u e h e l m e t a n d b l a c k Meteor backpack.
 I enjoy teaching people how to solve Rubik's cubes, and can teach most people in about 3 hrs. Here's an o​ld website​I put up. I'd be happy to lead a mealtime cubing club for anyone interested.
