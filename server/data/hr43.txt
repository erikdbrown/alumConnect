Mario Yeung


Mario Yeung


Before Hack Reactor I graduated from a community college with an associate degree in Computer Science


I was born in Hong Kong and had lived in there for 20 years. Three years ago I moved to United States, and have been living in Reno (a city in Nevada).


I like algorithm the most because I like abstract and logical thinking. Other interests include, but are not limited to, using modern technology (especially apps and smart devices) to solve daily problems.


I have some C++ experience at school and preparation for Hack Reactor interview. Of course this doesn't mean I'm good at programming because the key thing is algorithm (i.e., designing a program and thinking) rather than syntax.


- I just went to Hong Kong to visit my family and friends. - I am a coffee nerd with a lot of coffee makers at home. - I rarely eat fast food.

Asif Ahmed


Asifuzzaman Ahmed ( Asif / Ah-sef for short / Ah-sef-uz-zah-man Ah- med full pronunciation)


I was born in Bangladesh, but I lost my accent growing up in the Midwest. I earned my bachelors in Chicago and worked with ad agencies and magazines before moving out to Los Angeles where I was the lead designer at a brewery.


Los Angeles, California.


One day we will be able to vote, apply for a driving license, and take part in approving/editing legislation from our own home. I’d like to help build that technology.


I'm self-taught.

Nicole Skoglund


Nicole Skoglund (long o in the last name, same pronunciation as the ‘o’ in ‘nicole’).
Nic or Nicole is okay but not Nicky.


I have a BA in architecture, but have never really used it. I would describe myself as a jack of all trades, master of none. My most recent position was purchasing manager at a tiny mom-and-pop-style health foods shop. I’ve always gravitated towards small independent businesses, in terms of employment.


Saint Paul, MN. Grew up in Duluth (the port town on the tip of Lake Superior).


1) I like to understand How Things Work, in an expansive, general sense.
 2) When I think about ‘things that can help make the world a better place’, the two categories that come to mind are Education and Conflict Resolution. So, I’m interested in the ways that technology interfaces with these issues.
3) More specifically but still adequately vague: How to efficiently communicate/instruct programming concepts. Non- traditional educational models and access to. Visual representations of algorithm behavior. Would be curious to see a comparative analysis of the evolution of programming languages from a linguistic perspective. History of technology. How technology changes how we behave and view ourselves on a societal level. The digital divide and implications thereof.


I took programming 101 as an elective in my senior year of undergrad (Lisp? Java? I think?). I recall liking it, and being kinda bummed that I hadn’t discovered it earlier. Then I forgot about it, and later began teaching myself web design as a hobby. I picked up small freelance projects on and off during my 20s. I’ve dabbled in Linux, Drupal, Ruby on Rails. For years I’ve felt that I’m stuck at a plateau of what I can accomplish through isolated self- instruction, and I’m super excited that Hack Reactor represents the end of that limbo.


- I’m terrible at small talk, but have gotten better at faking it when required.
- Love travel, and lived/worked in New Zealand for two years.
- Love the Northwest. Planning to look for work in SF, Oregon or Washington post-HR.
- Love cats, but little dogs are ok too.
- Love Bikram yoga. Planning to visit the studio in North Beach on Sundays, for anyone who may be interested in joining me.
- Love minimalism.
- Don’t own a car. Prefer not to whenever it’s feasible.
- Would love a big garden, if I ever stay in one place long enough to grow one.
- I don’t really use social media, which is a bit like wearing an invisibility cloak.
- I haven’t seen Star Wars — any of them. Well, technically I have but I was like 6 so I don’t really remember it. No
spoilers.

Tai Huynh


I’m Anhtai Huynh (pronounced ‘and-thai whin’ (pretend you’re Stewie from Family Guy and say cool-whip, but instead of whip, it’s whin.))
Or you can just call me Tai.


 Mostly trying to stay out of trouble, really.
I’ve been working in B2B Sales for a wireless telecom company here in the bay area, and also doing music gigs and before that, shows in the Vietnamese community around the states for a while.


San Jose, just roughly a bit over an hour away from SF.


Definitely education, and anything else that could be made better (if not revolutionized) with technology, such as with AirBnB with the hospitality industry, Uber with the transportation industry, etc. My main interest in particular is audio engineering design and noise pollution, seeing that a lot of the spaces we're in are poorly designed acoustically (sound does matter!).
Security also comes into mind, especially as we’re moving towards a more connected world.


Absolutely none.


~ I used to BBoy (breakdance), parkour (free-running), and trick quite a bit in the past 1.5 * decade or so. Teachers and authorities have always had a love/hate relationship with it because they were scared that I’d get hurt. Never broken a bone in my entire life.
~ I used to write guides on how to breakdance on a now-defunct forum when I was 15-16.
~ I used to be a cheapass in high school and never wanted to pay the $10 to get into the dances, so I would scale my high school ‘big gym’ (which was about 3-4 stories high) to the roof from the outside, and sneak in from the top and make my way down to the inside. (I did this quite often and on all kinds of buildings, because people said it couldn’t be done, or because it seemed fun.
~ I studied to become a professional classical trombonist in college (think chamber music, or practicing orchestral excerpts to audition for a spot in a major symphony orchestra).
~ I gained 25-30 pounds over the last year. This is a major feat for me because it was practically impossible for a while.
~ I enjoyed my first-time international solo travel last year so much that I got into MS/CC churning. Because traveling shouldn’t be expensive.
~ I like a lot of Stevie Wonder's work.




Aezed Raza

So much. Most recently I've been running a small nonprofit in SF, doing international development. I'm also on a road trip down the California coast through the Southwest, currently in Vegas!


I've lived in SF for awhile, now in the Mission District.


Like many of you, I am very interested in the intersection of tech and education. I also think machine learning and AR/VR is going to be a really fun field moving forward.

Houston


UI Design, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Developing for Corporations


Inundated in VBA, once upon a time, brushed on C++/C#/PHP/80x86


Like to run. Like fun clothes -- I think I've spent an unfortunate portion of my income on such :(.
I tried to learn how to sing before I came here, but only got so far: my dream is to go Christmas caroling someday and for people not to hate it or to be on stage someday for a legitimate talent. I like mingling and meeting new people; although after a while it sometimes hits me how exhausted I am. I do best when I'm moderately distracted -- I'm usually pacing in circles when I'm alone and working on something.
I like most people, but anxious people pose are emotionally challenging for me. So if that's you, you can probably help me become a better rounded and healthier person. We can be friends, albeit slightly uncomfortably. ;-) If you want to make money by cheating people (*angry face* urrrgghhhh!), then we will probably not be friends.
I'm wild at heart and enjoy an adventurous life. I am slow to make commitments, but am 100% once I'm decided, and I try to move as fast as I can before so I don't get interested in something else before I'm done. I love the prospect of joining Hack Reactor because I love the idea of working and learning with the best and that's what this is.

Mala Neti


Hi everyone! My name is Mala Neti.


A little bit about my life before Hack Reactor- I went to UC Berkeley where I studied Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. After college, I've been working primarily in the biotech industry, first at a startup developing a microfluidics platform, and more recently at a health tech startup here in soma, helping to build a noninvasive wearable glucose sensor, as part of the R&D sensor development team.


I'm right here in sf! I was actually born and raised in the Bay Area, went to Cal, and worked in SF- so I basically never left haha.


I have a wide range of tech interests, but I'm specifically interested in machine learning, algorithms, big data, and data science especially as it related to biosensors and digital health technology. I also love playing around with my arduino and raspberry pi on occasion :)


The programming experience I have mostly comes from engineering at Berkeley, where I used a lot of Matlab, and from my internships/jobs in the tech and biotech industries, where I dabbled more in Python. More recently I've been doing a lot of self study in preparation for Hack Reactor!


There are a lot of things I love to do for fun- I love to sing, specifically acapella music. In college, I was part of an all girls acapella group where I sang as a bass, and did the occasional beatboxing as well :) Other than that, I love all things chemistry, cooking, meeting new people, and going on outdoor adventures in the city!

I'm interested in software development and big data analytics and how it can improve the accessibility of higher level education, especially MOOCs, and entertainment media.


I've taken a couple formal courses in school and used Matlab while at College; otherwise mostly self-taught Java and C++.


Although my taste palette is far from refined, I love eating and trying new foods (often at my body's expense!). Was an active player in the esports community for a couple years while in high school much to my family's chagrin.
An avid reader and an amateur writer in my free time.
Tucked away in a safety deposit box is a signed copy of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn and Jim Butcher's Codex Alera because of reasons.
